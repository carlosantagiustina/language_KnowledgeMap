 [[Sindhi]]:محاتما گاندهي; October 1869 – 30 January 1948) was a leader of [[nationalism]] in [[British Raj|British-ruled India]]. He is more commonly called Mahatma Gandhi;&lt;ref&gt;Chakrabarty, Bid Social and Political Thought of Mahatma Gandhi Routledge 2006 page 1&lt;/ref&gt; mahatma is an [[honorific]] meaning &quot;great-soul&quot; or &quot;venerable&quot; in [[Sanskrit]]. He was first called this in 1914 in South Africa. He is also called Bapu in India ([[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] endearment for &quot;father&quot;, &quot;papa&quot;).He was the Martyr of the Nation since 1948. [[Rabindranath Tagore]] gave him the title of 'Mahatma'.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;Gandhiji was one of the most important people involved in the movement for the independence of India. He was a [[non-violence|non-violent]] [[activist]], who led the independence movement through a non-violent [[protest]].Mohandas Gandhi was born on October 2, 1869 in Porbandar, Gujarat, India.&lt;ref&gt;Hook, Sue van der Mahatma Gandhi: Proponent of Peace ABDO 2011 page 14&lt;/ref&gt; Several members of his family worked for the government of the state. When Gandhi was 18 years old, he went to [[England]] to study law.&lt;ref&gt;Agarwal, Satya P. Social Message of the Gita Motilal Banarsidass; 1st edition 1995 page 114&lt;/ref&gt; After he became a [[lawyer]], he went to the British colony of [[South Africa]] where he experienced laws that said people with dark [[Human skin colour|skin]] had worse rights than people with light skin. He decided then to become a political activist, so he could help change these unfair laws. He created a powerful, non-violent movement. During Gandhi's life, India was a [[colony]] of the [[United Kingdom]], but wanted [[independence]].In 1930, Gandhi led the [[Salt March]].When he returned to India, he helped cause India's independence from British rule, inspiring other colonial people to work for their own independence, break up the [[British Empire]], and replace it with the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]].People of many different [[religion]]s and [[ethnic group]]s lived in British India. Many people thought that the country should break into separate countries so that different groups could have their own countries. In particular, many people thought that [[Hinduism|Hindus]] and [[Islam|Muslims]] should have separate countries. Gandhi was a Hindu, but he liked ideas from many religions including [[Islam]], [[Judaism]] and [[Christianity]], and he thought that people of all religions should have the same rights, and could live together peacefully in the same country.In 1938, Gandhi resigned from Congress. He said that he was no longer able to work through Congress to unite the divisions in caste and religion. He also felt that he had little to offer to the political process.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Jad.

Page 217.&lt;/ref&gt;In 1947, [[British Raj|British Indian Empire]] became independent, and broke into two different countries, India and [[Pakistan]]. Gandhi wanted independence, but did not want to split into two different countries. Instead of celebrating on independence day, he was crying over the division of India.Gandhi's principle of satyagraha, often translated as &quot;way of truth&quot; or &quot;pursuit of truth&quot;, has inspired other democratic and anti-racist activists like [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] and [[Nelson Mandela]]. Gandhi often said that his values were simple, based upon traditional Hindu beliefs: truth (satya), and non-violence (ahimsa).On January 30, 1948, Gandhi was [[Assassination of Mahatma Gandhi|assassinated by an extremist Hindu activist]] , [[Nathuram Godse]]. He shot him because he felt that Gandhi was too towards Muslims. As a punishment for this he was [[hanging|hanged]].[[Category:Time People of the Year]]
